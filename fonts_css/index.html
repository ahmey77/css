    <h1>What is CSS font formatting?</h1>
    <p>The CSS fonts module defines font-related properties and how font resources are loaded. It lets you define the
        style of
        a font, such as its family, size and weight, and the glyph variants to use when multiple are available for a
        single
        character.</p>
